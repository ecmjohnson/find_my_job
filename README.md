# find_my_job
is an online job meta-search agent that monitors openings in your locations and
areas of interest and notifies you of particularly satisfying job
opportunities.

This project was written for Carleton University's IEEE branches' SLAM (Stay
Late and Make) program's monthly challenges (if that's a deep enough level of
recursion for you). The challenge for this project was to use an API.
